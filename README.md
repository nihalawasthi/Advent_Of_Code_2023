<h1>Advent Of Code</h1>
<h3>Python 3.12</h3>
<p>
Welcome to the Advent of Code 2023 repository! This repository contains all of the CTF questions I solved in December 2023.

<h3>About Advent of Code</h3>
Advent of Code is an annual programming event that begins on December 1st. Each day, a new programming puzzle is released. The puzzles are designed to be fun and challenging, and they can be solved using a variety of programming languages.

<h3>Goals</h3>
My goal for this repository was to solve all of the Advent of Code puzzles in December 2023. I documented my solutions in this repository, and I shared my code with others who were interested in learning more about Advent of Code.

<h3>Participation</h3>
I encourage others to participate in Advent of Code next time. It is a great way to learn new programming techniques and to challenge yourself.
